ThawSlump
=====
ThawSlump is a model for understanding  the spatial and temporal characteristics of thaw slump displacement.

Introduction
-----
Thaw slump, caused by permafrost degradation, ground ice melting, and so on, affects the engineering construction and permafrost environment in the Qinghai-Tibetan Engineering Corridor. Most of the current studies investigate from the angle of thermodynamics instead of the actual deformation of thaw slump; and the understanding of the spatial and temporal characteristics of thaw slump displacement is very limited.
